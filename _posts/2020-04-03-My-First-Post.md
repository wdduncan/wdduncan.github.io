This my first post using github.io! I am learning how to post content using jekyll.

Next I will explore how to edit the site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of my repository (shown below).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

More instructions are found at the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
